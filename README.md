### Documentation

* [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/ddugovic/omgwords-agent/blob/master/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): A somewhat comprehensive outline of the layout of our codebase, our thoughts behind its design, and the basics of adding to it in a way that preserves scalability and growth.
* [SETUP_QUICK.md](https://github.com/ddugovic/omgwords-agent/blob/master/docs/SETUP_QUICK.md): An outline of what it takes to set up a development and testing environment, a necessary step if you want to submit pull requests and/or become a regular contributor.

Additionally, there exists a more comprehensive setup guide for those who intend to become regular contributors:
* [SETUP_ROBUST.md](https://github.com/ddugovic/omgwords-agent/blob/master/docs/SETUP_ROBUST.md): A guide to setting up a more robust development environment if the quick setup is insufficient.
